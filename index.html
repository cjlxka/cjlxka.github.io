        <h2 id="Problem"><a href="#Problem" class="headerlink" title="Problem:"></a>Problem:</h2><p>Nowadays, we use many smart devices in our homes, and the instruction of each device varies a lot. An intelligent hub is needed to <strong>organize devices</strong> via <strong>motion capturing</strong>, which can save users from memorizing the various instructions of different devices. In addition, this hub can also capture users’ motions to be a <strong>fitness coach</strong>, or help them <strong>try on clothes</strong> virtually.</p>
<h2 id="Users"><a href="#Users" class="headerlink" title="Users:"></a>Users:</h2><p>\1.   Users may have multiple smart devices in their homes, but they are reluctant to remember different devices’ complicated and diverse instructions. Therefore, an intelligent hub can help our users organize their devices.</p>
<p>\2.   People who love workouts but don’t go to the fitness center.</p>
<p>\3.   People who buy clothes online, but don’t know whether the clothes suit them.</p>
<p>Task Scenarios:</p>
<p>\1.   Users don’t remember the instructions of different devices. Also, users can’t operate the devices by themselves because of their work at hand.</p>
<p>\2.   Users do workouts in their homes, but they can’t find instructors.</p>
<p>\3.   In the kitchen where heavy work (e.g. preparing ingredients, dishwashing, etc.) is done every day.</p>
<p>\4.   Users would like to buy clothes online, but they are confused if the clothes suit them.</p>
<p>\5.   Users who need a robot to clean the house.</p>
<p>Tasks:</p>
<p>\1.   The hub uses <strong>motion capturing</strong> and <strong>speech recognition</strong> to understand the user’s body and spoken language, then operate the corresponding devices. The instruction can be customed based on the user’s preference so that they can be easily remembered. For example, a spoken instruction like “XX on&#x2F;off” can turn on&#x2F;off a light in the house; and with a finger pointing to the door, the door would be closed or opened automatically.</p>
<p>\2.   The user can set his&#x2F;her training plans and use the camera set in his home as a fitness coach. The camera set in a room can capture the user’s gestures and motions sensitively, thus providing the user with adjusting suggestions.</p>
<p>\3.   The intelligent kitchen could be regarded as an important part of the comprehensive household processing hub since quite a lot of human-computer interaction techniques are applied to help simplify the cooking process. In the preliminary step, the hub could take down the dishes the user is going to make in a day and order the fresh ingredients in need from the markets in the morning. In the cooking process, the smart kitchen could also follow the user’s instructions to help set timings and do the basic fire controlling jobs. Once the dining is finished, the center could also calculate the perfect dish-washing time according to the dishes needed to be cleaned and washed.</p>
<p>\4.   Based on the user’s body size and the clothes’ size, the hub uses <strong>augmented reality</strong> to show the user how him&#x2F;her looks on the clothes.</p>
<p>\5.   The camera of the hub can detect which part of the room needs to be cleaned, then notify the user. The user can clean the room by himself&#x2F;herself or use a cleaning robot.</p>
<p>Team roles and Tasks:</p>
<p><strong>CHEN Yiting and GU Chenhe</strong> proposed the idea of using motion capturing in intelligent homes.</p>
<p><strong>CHEN Mingyi</strong> built up the website.</p>
<p><strong>CHEN Hongzhuo</strong> analyzed users and tasks</p>

        <h2 id="Problem"><a href="#Problem" class="headerlink" title="Problem"></a>Problem</h2><p>In modern times, numerous smart devices are employed in a home with each one having its own utility, but there lacks a comprehensive processing smart center to help make the electronics organized. Thus, users may spend a lot of time memorizing the instructions and organizing the devices</p>
<h2 id="Target-users"><a href="#Target-users" class="headerlink" title="Target users"></a>Target users</h2><p>families preferring to live a modern life with multiple smart devices at hand</p>
<h2 id="Solution"><a href="#Solution" class="headerlink" title="Solution"></a>Solution</h2><p>The newly designed comprehensive household processing center comes off incredibly smart and convenient for use. Based on HCI technology, the system mainly captures the body language and oral instructions of the users, then organizing and controlling the whole electronic appliances correspondingly, thus managing the integration and simplifying the overall instructions. Of all the functions realized in this system, the most universally seen and used is the switch-controlling one. With a simple “XX on&#x2F;off” oral instruction, any light in this house would be turned on or off; and with a finger pointing the door you want to open or close, the door would then get closed or opened automatically. By the way, the instructions can be set according to your own likings and preferences so that they could be remembered and used easily. Take the fit room as another example. Cameras set in this room could capture the user’s gestures and motions sensitively, thus instructing the user with adjusting suggestions. Users could also set their training plan ahead of time and use the monitor center as a guild or even a private coach. A more frequently used place is the kitchen, where heavy works have been done daily for good meals. Smart kitchen could be regarded as an important part of the comprehensive household processing center since quite a lot HCI techniques are applied here to help simplify the cooking process. In the preliminary step, the center could take down the dishes the user is going to make in a day and order the fresh ingredients in need from the markets in the morning. In the cooking process, the smart kitchen could also follow the user’s instructions to help set timings and do the basic fire controlling job. Once the eating is finished, the center could also calculate the perfect dish-washing time according to the dishes needed to be cleaned and washed. Aside from the fitness and cooking part, the smart household center also includes some commonly used functions, liking a virtual try-on mirror and small robots for cleaning up. Also, the functions could be upgraded and fulfilled according to the related devices a user owns. The more the devices there are in a home, the more instructions and work the center could do. For example, if the oven in the kitchen is also part of the products belonging to the smart center, then upon being connected, processes related with baking could be finished automatically.</p>
